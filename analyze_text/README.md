# Simple Text Analysis

In this short project, I demonstrate how to use a textacy (a very handy natural language processing tool built on top of spacy) to perform some quick analytics on a body of text data 
- We start with some pre-processing, removing unwanted pieces of text and then continue with a simple word count. 
- We then extend the analysis to extract multi-word phrases (n-grams) from the text with the goal of identifying some frequently occurring phrases that might tell us what is important in the full body of text
- Finally we apply named entity recognition to the text to find out the entities (people, places, organization etc) mentioned in the text

# Visualizing Text
Text can be beautiful. In this project, I demonstrate how to convert a body of text into one of the many visual representations. Specifically, we turn our source text into a semantic network, which basically gives us a way to visualize the concepts in a body of text.
There are many other text visualizations that we can explore later in addition to the one illustrated here. But they are all preceded by similar preprocessing steps used to extract the information to visualize.
